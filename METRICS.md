# Metrics — [PROJECT NAME]

> DORA 2025 (METRICS-02): Rework rate added as a new core metric alongside the
> traditional four. "AI-assisted teams that don't track rework see throughput gains
> consumed by hidden instability."
>
> Run `npm run metrics` for the weekly snapshot. Update this doc monthly.

## The Five Metrics We Track

| Metric | Target | ⚠️ Warning | ❌ Stop | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rework rate** | < 10% | 10–20% | > 20% | `scripts/weekly-metrics.sh` |
| **Change failure rate** | < 5% | 5–15% | > 15% | Error monitoring |
| **PR revision rate** | < 25% | 25–40% | > 40% | GitHub Insights |
| **Lead time (issue → deploy)** | < 3 days | 3–7 days | > 7 days | GitHub Projects |
| **CI cycle time** | < 4 min | 4–8 min | > 8 min | GitHub Actions |

## Rework Rate (New in DORA 2025)

**Definition:** Lines substantially changed or reverted within 14 days of being authored,
as a percentage of total lines authored in the period.

**Why it matters:** Rework rate is the earliest signal that AI output quality is degrading
or that `AGENTS.md` / `copilot-instructions.md` needs updating.

**Response protocol:**
- **0–10%:** Healthy. Copilot output is landing well.
- **10–20%:** Watch. Check for prompt pattern drift. Run a PROCESS tuning session.
- **> 20%:** Stop adding features. Fix the instructions first. Review `docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` changelog.

**Measurement:**
```bash
npm run metrics  # includes rework rate from scripts/weekly-metrics.sh
```

## Change Failure Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of deploys that cause a user-visible bug, crash, or required rollback.

**Response protocol:**
1. Deploy causes error spike → automated alert fires
2. Follow `docs/RUNBOOKS.md` → Change Failure Response runbook
3. Root cause: Was it a Copilot pattern failure? Update `AGENTS.md`.
4. Root cause: Was it an untested edge case? Add regression test.

---

## PR Revision Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of PRs requiring at least one revision request before merge.

A rising PR revision rate means one of:
- Issues are too vague (PMs need to write better specs)
- Copilot is not following architecture rules (update `AGENTS.md`)
- Review is inconsistent (update `docs/RUNBOOKS.md` review checklist)

## Developer Experience (DevEx) Score

> DORA 2025: "The platform capability most correlated with positive developer experience
> is giving clear feedback on the outcome of tasks."

Track monthly in `docs/DEVEX_LOG.md`. Five dimensions, scored 1–5:

| Dimension | Question | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Flow | How often do I reach flow state? | ≥ 4 |
| Feedback Speed | How fast does the system tell me when something is wrong? | ≥ 4 |
| Cognitive Load | How much mental effort does the codebase require? | ≤ 3 |
| AI Trust | How often do I accept Copilot output with confidence? | ≥ 3 |
| Tooling Friction | How often does a tool block my work? | ≤ 2 |

**Trigger:** Any dimension < 3 for two consecutive months → file an improvement issue.

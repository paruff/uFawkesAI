# Developer Experience Log — [PROJECT NAME]

> DORA 2025 (DEVEX-01): "The platform capability most correlated with positive developer
> experience is giving clear feedback on the outcome of tasks."
> Monthly self-assessment. 5 minutes. Last Friday of each month.
> See `docs/RUNBOOKS.md` → Monthly DevEx Review for instructions.

## Monthly Log

| Month         | Flow | Feedback Speed | Cognitive Load\* | AI Trust | Tooling Friction\* | Notes       |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| [PLACEHOLDER] |      |                |                  |          |                    | First entry |

\*Lower is better for Cognitive Load and Tooling Friction. Target ≤ 3.

## Trigger Table

| Condition                                      | Action                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Any dimension < 3 for 1 month                  | Note and monitor                                                      |
| Any dimension < 3 for **2 consecutive months** | **File an improvement issue immediately**                             |
| Cognitive Load ≥ 4 for 1 month                 | Run Value Stream Mapping — codebase may have accumulated complexity   |
| AI Trust < 3 for 1 month                       | Review `AGENTS.md` and `docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` — update instructions |
| Tooling Friction ≥ 4 for 1 month               | File a developer platform improvement issue                           |
| Flow < 3 for 2 months                          | Review sprint batch size — tasks may be too large or poorly scoped    |

## Dimension Definitions

**Flow** — How often do development sessions produce a state of sustained focus and momentum?

- Score 5: Almost every session
- Score 1: Constant interruptions; rarely finish a task without switching context

**Feedback Speed** — How quickly does the system (CI, tests, Copilot, linter) tell me when something is wrong?

- Score 5: Errors surface within seconds–minutes
- Score 1: I only learn something is wrong when it reaches production

**Cognitive Load** — How much mental effort does navigating the codebase and tooling require?

- Score 1 (target): The codebase is clear; architecture is predictable; tooling is transparent
- Score 5 (problem): I have to hold too many things in my head; the code is hard to navigate

**AI Trust** — How often do I accept Copilot output with confidence vs. needing to substantially rewrite?

- Score 5: Output is almost always correct and architecturally sound
- Score 1: I spend more time correcting AI output than I save

**Tooling Friction** — How often does a tool, script, CI step, or process block or slow my work?

- Score 1 (target): Tools work; CI is fast; scripts are reliable
- Score 5 (problem): Frequent tool failures, slow CI, scripts that need babysitting

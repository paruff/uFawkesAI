# Team Archetype Self-Assessment — [PROJECT NAME]

> DORA 2025: "Seven team archetypes experience AI adoption differently and require
> different interventions. Without accurate self-assessment, teams misallocate AI investment."
>
> Complete this before Phase 1 work begins. Revisit quarterly.
> The archetype determines which controls to add first.

## The Seven Archetypes

| # | Archetype | Key Signals | AI Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Foundational Challenges** | Survival mode, process gaps, high burnout | AI accelerates chaos |
| 2 | **Legacy Bottleneck** | Unstable systems, constant firefighting | AI speeds code; broken deploy consumes gains |
| 3 | **Constrained by Process** | Slow, bureaucratic workflows | AI creates friction with process overhead |
| 4 | **High Impact, Low Cadence** | Quality work, slow delivery, low stability | Need automation to unlock cadence |
| 5 | **Stable and Methodical** | Deliberate, high quality, consistent delivery | AI can safely accelerate here |
| 6 | **Pragmatic Performers** | Fast, functional, effective delivery | AI creates PR review backlog at scale |
| 7 | **Harmonious High-Achievers** | Virtuous cycle: well-being + performance | AI multiplies advantages |

## Self-Assessment

**Date:** [PLACEHOLDER]

### Evidence from the last 30 days

| Indicator | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Deployment frequency | deploys / week |
| Average PR cycle time (open → merge) | days |
| Change failure rate | % |
| Rework rate | % |
| DevEx score | /5 (if available) |
| Team friction observations | [describe] |

### Archetype selection

**Our closest archetype:** [PLACEHOLDER — e.g. "5 — Stable and Methodical"]

**Reasoning:** [PLACEHOLDER — 2–3 sentences explaining why this fits]

**The two or three weakest DORA AI capabilities for our archetype:**

## Archetype-Specific Priority Adjustments

### If Archetypes 1 or 2 (Foundational / Legacy Bottleneck)
**Elevate first:** CI/CD stability, observability, error monitoring, Firestore security rules
**Logic:** Fix stability before accelerating throughput. AI on an unstable foundation accelerates instability.
**Defer:** Prompt library, advanced agents, feature velocity

### If Archetype 3 (Constrained by Process)
**Elevate first:** Small batch enforcement, PR process streamlining, bottleneck removal
**Logic:** Reduce friction first. AI will amplify remaining friction.
**Defer:** New feature work until flow is improved

### If Archetype 4 (High Impact, Low Cadence)
**Elevate first:** Deploy automation, CI speed, environment promotion
**Logic:** Automation to unlock deployment frequency before adding AI velocity
**Defer:** Advanced prompt engineering until deploy pipeline is reliable

### If Archetypes 5 or 6 (Stable / Pragmatic Performers)
**Proceed as planned.** Current implementation order is appropriate.
**Watch for:** PR review becoming a bottleneck as AI increases PR volume. Elevate REVIEW-01.

### If Archetype 7 (Harmonious High-Achievers)
**Accelerate:** Feature velocity. Foundation is sound.
**Focus on:** Metrics visibility to maintain advantage as scale increases

## Quarterly Re-assessment

Review cadence: first week of each quarter.

Questions to ask:
- Has deployment frequency or stability changed significantly?
- Has team composition changed?
- Has the rework rate or DevEx score shifted by more than 1 point?
- If yes to any: re-run this assessment and update the priority adjustments

**Next review date:** [PLACEHOLDER]

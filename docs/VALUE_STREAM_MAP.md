# Value Stream Map — [PROJECT NAME]

> DORA 2025 (VSM-01): "VSM acts as an AI force multiplier. By visualising your flow
> from idea to customer, you can identify where work waits and where friction exists.
> Without it, AI creates local optimisations that pile up work downstream."
>
> Complete before Phase 2 work begins. Review monthly.
> Instructions: For each step, record average wait time, active time, and primary failure reason
> from your last 10 PRs.

## Step-by-Step Data

| Step | Avg Wait Time | Avg Active Time | Primary Failure Reason | AI Insertion Point |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Issue Created | — | 15 min | Vague spec | PM uses Copilot to draft AC |
| Spec Written | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | Missing acceptance criteria | — |
| Agent Implements | 0 (async) | [PLACEHOLDER] | Architecture violation | Copilot implements from spec |
| Human Review | **[MEASURE THIS]** | [PLACEHOLDER] | Unclear diff | @review-agent pre-screens |
| CI Gates | 0 | [target: < 4 min] | Test failure | Automated |
| Merge | [PLACEHOLDER] | 5 min | Merge conflict | — |
| Deploy | [PLACEHOLDER] | [PLACEHOLDER] | Build error | Automated |
| User Feedback | [PLACEHOLDER] | ongoing | No analytics | — |
